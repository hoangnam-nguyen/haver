<h2>Get Time Series from a Haver Database (legacy function / help entry)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Get one or more time series, convert them to the same frequency, and 
store them in a zoo object. Frequency aggregation is currently supported,
but not disaggregation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
dlxGetData(varnames, database, start, end, frequency, .colnames)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>varnames</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of Haver variable names. You can either give just the variable 
name, or a combination of the database name and variable name in the 
format<br />
&quot;DATABASE:VARIABLE&quot;. If a database is not given, then the series 
will be assumed to reside in the database given in the function's 
database argument.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>database</code></td>
<td>

<p>A Haver database name (with no filename extension). Each variable name 
that does not explictly contain a database name will be assumed to 
reside in this database. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>start</code></td>
<td>

<p>Optional starting date for the time series window, defined using either 
a Date object or something that can be coerced to a Date (such as a 
string, POSIXct, or chron object). Leave blank to start at the latest 
date that still captures all the series. If the provided starting date 
is earlier than the first value of any of the series in your query, than 
the zoo object will be padded with blank values. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>end</code></td>
<td>

<p>Optional ending date for the time series window. defined using either a 
Date object or something that can be coerced to a Date (such as a 
string, POSIXct, or chron object). Leave blank to end at the earliest 
date which still captures all the series. If the provided ending date is 
later than the last value of any of the series in your query, than the 
zoo object will be padded with blank values. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>frequency</code></td>
<td>

<p>Optional frequency that the time series should be converted to, IF 
POSSIBLE. Options are &quot;d&quot;, &quot;wmon&quot;, &quot;wtue&quot;, &quot;wwed&quot;, &quot;wthu&quot;, &quot;wfri&quot;, 
&quot;wsat&quot;, &quot;wsun&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;a&quot;. If left blank, all series are converted 
to the frequency of the lowest-frequency series listed in varnames. For 
instance, if you pass in the names of monthly and quarterly series then 
the resulting block will come back as quarterly. 
</p>
<p>The frequency option will have no effect if you specify a frequency that 
is higher than the lowest frequency series in your list of variables. 
For example, if you request a monthly and quarterly series and ask for 
monthly frequency then you will still get data in a quarterly frequency. 
On the other hand, if you asked for annual data, the resulting data 
would in fact be annual. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.colnames</code></td>
<td>

<p>Optional vector of column names to be used for the zoo object. Length 
must be equal to varnames. If no values are given, the zoo object will 
use lowercase Haver variable names. 
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A zoo object indexed by Date objects. The Date objects are set to the last
day in each period.
</p>
